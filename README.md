# Even & Odd Number Generator (Smart Range - C Program)

This simple C program allows users to generate all even or odd numbers within a specified range. It automatically adjusts the start number if it's not evenly divisible by 2, based on the user's choice. Useful for beginners learning loops and conditionals in C.

## ðŸ› How It Works

1. User selects:
   - `1` for Even numbers
   - `2` for Odd numbers

2. User provides the **start** and **end** of the range.

3. Program:
   - Adjusts the start value if needed.
   - Loops through the range with a step of 2 to print even or odd numbers.

## Sample Output
Type
1 for even numbers
2 for an odd number
: 2
Where to start and end?
Type Start and End Number: 4 15
Odd numbers from 5 to 15 are:
5
7
9
11
13
15
